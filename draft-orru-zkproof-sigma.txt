Abstract

   This document describes Sigma protocols, a secure, general-purpose
   non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge.  Concretely, the
   scheme allows proving knowledge of a witness, without revealing any
   information about the undisclosed messages or the signature itself,
   while at the same time, guarantying soundness of the overall
   protocols.

1.  Introduction

   Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge allow a prover to convince a
   verifier that they know a secret piece of information, without
   revealing anything except that the claim itself already reveals.
   Sigma protocols, introduced by Schnorr in 1991, they play an
   essential component in the building of a number of cryptographic
   constructions, such as anonymous credentials, password-authenticated
   key exchange, signatures, ring signatures, blind signatures, multi-
   signatures, threshold signatures and more.  This spec provides
   guidelines for correctly implementing Sigma protocols.

1.1.  Terminology

   R[name]  the _relation_, potentially associated a to a name for
      disambiguation: the set of valid instances and witnesses for the
      proof system.

   Y  the _instance_: the public information shared between the prover
      and the verifier.

   w  the _witness_. The secret information solely known by the prover.
      Note there may be multiple witnesses for a given Y.

   proof  The zero-knowledge proof output.

   In a zero-knowledge proof, the _witness_ is secret information, while
   the _statement_ is public.  A _proof_ is a sequence of bytes
   attesting that a witness is in some relation with the statement.

   Proofs described in this spec are zero-knowledge and sound.  Zero
   knowledge means that the protocol does not leak any information about
   the prover's witness beyond what the attacker may infer from the
   proven statement or from other sources [@zkproof-reference 1.6.4].
   Soundness means that it is not possible to make the verifier accept
   for statements for which no valid witness exists [@zkproof-reference
   1.6.2].

   In particular, we will focus on non-malleable extractable proofs,
   that is, proofs where the witness does not only exist but is also
   precisely known by the prover.  These protocols are also known as
   proofs of knowledge [@STOC:GolMicRac85; @STOC:FeiFiaSha87;
   @C:BelGol92] and are said to satisfy _knowledge
   soundness_ [@damgard04].  Non-malleability means that, in addition,
   the proof is secure against man-in-the middle attacks, and attackers
   cannot produce a new valid proof by tampering another valid proof.

1.2.  Notation

   GG  A safe elliptic-curve group.

   point_to_octets_GG(P) -> ostr  Return the canonical representation of
      the point P of the elliptic curve GG as an octet string.  This
      operation is also known as serialization.  Note that we assume
      that when the point is valid, all the serialization operations
      will always succeed to return the octet string representation of
      the point.

   Additional notation will be introduced when describing specific
   algebraic objects.

1.4.  Scope of this document

   This document provides guidelines for secure implementations of Sigma
   protocols and is addressed to applied cryptographers and
   cryptographic engineers that are looking to implement a generic Sigma
   protocol or provide an ad-hoc instantiation as part of larger
   protocols.

   We consider the problem of having a high-quality entropy source well-
   suited for cryptographic purposes outside the scope of this document.
   We will not talk about implementation of cryptographic primitives
   such as hash functions, or elliptic-curve algebra, but we will
   provide references for where to find them.  Furthermore, we won't
   provide any guidance for securely storing secrets or producing
   constant-time code.

2.  Sigma protocols definition

   In the following, we describe a generic interface for Sigma
   protocols.  Such protocols can be used to prove that, for some binary
   relation R and a public value Y, a witness w such that (Y,w) is in R
   is known.  Basic statements include proofs of knowledge of a secret
   key, openings of commitments, and more in general of representations.
   The type of these elements depends on the specific relation being
   implemented.

   An important property of Sigma protocols is that they are composable:
   it is possible to prove conjunction and disjunctions of statements in
   zero-knowledge.  Composition of Sigma protocols is dealt separately;
   for an in-depth discussion of the underlying theory we refer to
   Cramer [@cramer97].

2.1.  Overview

   Any Sigma protocol is structured as follows:

   *  the prover computes a fresh *commitment*, denoted T.  This element
      is sometimes also called _nonce_.

   *  the prover computes, using the so-called Fiat-Shamir transform, a
      random *challenge*, denoted c.

   *  the prover computes a *response*, denoted s, that depends on the
      commitment and the challenge.

   The final proof is constituted of the three-elements above (T, c, s),
   and is also referred to as the *transcript*.

2.2.  Abstract Sigma Protocols

   We define a template class for Sigma protocols denoted SigmaProtocol.
   This is the basic interface that will be implemented remainder of
   this document.  The methods composing SigmaProtocol should be
   considered _private_ and SHOULD NOT be exposed externally.  The
   public API is described later.  Instances are created via the new
   function, which is a class method, while all other functions act on a
   particular instance.  A SigmaProtocol consists of the following
   methods:

   *  SigmaProtocol.new(ctx, Y), denoting the initialization function.
      This function takes as input a label identifying local context
      information ctx (such as: session identifiers, to avoid replay
      attacks; protocol metadata, to avoid hijacking; optionally, a
      timestamp and some pre-shared randomness, to guarantee freshness
      of the proof) and a statement Y, the public information shared
      between prover and verifier.  This function _should_ pre-compute
      parts of the statement, or initialize the state of the hash
      function.

   *  (T, pstate) = SigmaProtocol.prover_commit(w), denoting the
      _commitment phase_, that is, the computation of the first message
      sent by the prover in a Sigma protocol.  This method outputs a new
      commitment together with its associated prover state, depending on
      the witness known to the prover and the statement to be proven.
      This step generally requires access to a high-quality entropy
      source.  Leakage of even just of a few bits of the nonce could
      allow for the complete recovery of the witness [@lattice-attack;
      @bleichenbacher; @CCS:ANTTY20].  The value T is meant to be
      shared, while pstate must be kept secret.

      In particular, we assume that there exists a function Serialize(T)
      that serializes the commitment T and that its size is fixed and
      implicitly determined by the statement Y.

   *  s = SigmaProtocol.prover_response(pstate, c), denoting the
      _response phase_, that is, the computation of the second message
      sent by the prover, depending on the witness, the statement, the
      challenge received from the verifier, and the internal state
      generated by prover_commit.  The value s is meant to be shared.

   *  result = SigmaProtocol.verifier(T, c, s), denoting the _verifier
      algorithm_. This method checks that the _protocol transcript_ is
      valid for the given statement.  The verifier algorithm outputs
      nothing if verification succeeds, or an error if verification
      fails.

   *  label = SigmaProtocol.label(), returning a string of 32 bytes
      uniquely identifying the relation being proven.  Implementing this
      function correctly is vital for security, and it must include all
      data available in the statement, as well as the parameters and the
      relation being proven.  The label will be used for computing the
      challenge in the Fiat-Shamir transform.  Precise indications on
      how to implement this function will be given in the following
      sections.

      If the label is _not_ tied to the relation, then it may be
      possible to produce another proof for a different relation without
      knowing its witness.  Similarly, if the statement is not tied to
      the label, then it may be possible to produce proofs for another
      statement whose witness is related to the original proof.

   The final two algorithms describe the _zero-knowledge simulator_. The
   simulator is primarily an efficient algorithm for proving zero-
   knowledge in a theoretical construction [@becafi19], but it is also
   needed for verifying short proofs and for or-composition, where a
   witness is not known and thus has to be simulated.  We have:

   *  s <- SigmaProtocol.simulate_response(), denoting the first stage
      of the _simulator_. It is an algorithm drawing a random response
      that follows the same output distribution of the algorithm
      prover_response.

   *  T <- SigmaProtocol.simulate_commitment(c, s), denoting the second
      stage of the _simulator_, returning a commitment that follows the
      same output distribution of the algorithm prover_commit.

2.3.  The Fiat-Shamir Transform

   *WARNING*: Interactive Sigma protocols illustrated in this document
   MUST NOT be used interactively.

   The interactive versions of the Sigma protocols presented in this
   document are not fit for practical applications, due to subtle yet
   impactful details in their security guarantees.  In practice, public-
   coin protocols such as Sigma protocols can be converted into non-
   interactive ones through the Fiat and Shamir heuristic [@C:FiaSha86]
   and subsequent work, e.g., by Bernhard, Pereira and
   Warinschi [@AC:BerPerWar12].

   The underlying idea is to replace the verifier with a
   cryptographically secure hash function, hashing the context from the
   protocol and the previous message sent by the prover.

2.3.1.  Computing the challenge and seeding the commitment

   Relying on a hash function allows us to both compute the challenge
   and generate the commitment securely.  We define the following
   auxiliary variables that may be pre-computed during the call of
   SigmaProtocol.new(ctx, Y).  All variables will have fixed length
   DIGEST_LEN so to avoid canonicalization attacks.

2.3.1.1.  Seeding the commitment

   The method SigmaProtocol.prover_commit() is a randomized function
   that generates a random element, unique per each execution.  The
   commitment _should_ be seeded as follows:

   If the output length DIGEST_LEN of the hash function is not
   sufficient to provide enough entropy for the commitment, the seed may
   be expanded with a PRNG to provide the quantity of random bytes
   desired.

2.3.1.2.  Computing the challenge

   The method SigmaProtocol.challenge(T) is implemented as follows in
   order to produce a random challenge.

   This method is fixed for all implementations of SigmaProtocol.  Note
   that the state of the hash function is partially shared between the
   commitment seed inputs and the challenge computation.  Implementors
   may choose to store the partial hash state before generating the
   commitment, and reuse it when computing the challenge.

2.3.2.  Non-interactive proofs

   We define two _public methods_ for generating proofs, meant to be
   exposed externally: short_proof, and batchable_proof.  Since the
   challenge is computed deterministically from the commitment and the
   statement, it is not necessary to include the full transcript in a
   proof, as it can be deduced in the verification phase.

   Short proofs are the most efficient if the protocol contains at least
   an _AND_ composition, and the gain in size is measured as |T_vec| -
   DIGEST_LEN.  (Note: the length of the commitment is the length of the
   statement.)  Batchable proofs are the canonical forms of proofs.
   Provers in the batchable form may raise an exception if the statement
   is not valid.  Proofs are seen as fixed-length bit strings, whose
   exact length can be inferred from the statement during initialization
   of the Sigma protocol.

   ::: remark Witness validation In the following we assume correctness
   of the witness w for the given statement Y.  This can be ensured,
   e.g., by a higher-level application, or by running
   SigmaProtocol.verifier(T, c, s) before sending the resulting proof.
   :::

2.3.3.  Batchable Proofs

   Prover algorithm.

   SigmaProtocol.batchable_proof(w):
   (T_vec,pstate) = SigmaProtocol.prover_commit(w)
   c = SigmaProtocol.challenge(T)
   s_vec = SigmaProtocol.prover_response(pstate, c)
   return (Serialize(T_vec), Serialize(s_vec))

   The challenge c is not provided within a batchable proof since it can
   be re-computed from the commitment.

   Verifier algorithm.

   SigmaProtocol.batchable_verify(proof)
   (T,s) = Deserialize(proof)`
   c <- SigmaProtocol.challenge(T)`
   return SigmaProtocol.verifier(T, c, s)

   *WARNING* Input validation The case of batched verification must
   include an input validation sub-routine that asserts the statement
   and commitments are in question.  In the case of elliptic curves,
   this boils down to point validation.  Failure to properly check that
   a commitment is in the group could lead to subgroup
   attacks [@EC:VanWie96; @C:LimLee97] or invalid curve
   attacks [@C:BieMeyMul00; @RSA:BBPV12].

2.3.4.  Short Proofs

   Prover algorithm.

   SigmaProtocol.short_proof(w)
   (T,pstate) <- SigmaProtocol.prover_commit(w)
   c <- SigmaProtocol.challenge( T)`
   s_vec<- SigmaProtocol.prover_response(pstate,c)
   return (Serialize(c), Serialize(s))

   The commitment T is not provided within a short proof since it can be
   calculated again.

   Verifier algorithm.

   SigmaProtocol.short_verify(proof):
   (c, s) = Deserialize(proof)
   T<- SigmaProtocol.simulate_commitment(c, s)
   c^* <- SigmaProtocol.challenge(T)
   return (c==c^*)

   If input parsing fails, an exception should be raised.  If
   verification fails, an exception should be raised.  Otherwise, the
   verifier outputs True.  Optionally, the implementation can choose to
   return the parsed statement.

   ::: remark Availability of the short form While the short form as
   described here is applicable to all Sigma protocols currently covered
   by this document, it cannot be used for protocols where T is not
   uniquely determined by c and s, as is the case, e.g., for
   ZKBoo [@USENIX:GiaMadOrl16], one-out-of-many proofs [@EC:GroKoh15],
   or protocols, where a randomized signature is sent and proven correct
   subsequently, e.g., [@RSA:PoiSan16; @AC:CamChaShe08].

   A trade-off is presented, e.g., by Bobolz et al. [@EPRINT:BEHF21],
   requiring an additional algorithm to shorten a full transcript to a
   compressed form which still allows for unique reconstruction of the
   transcript. :::

3.  Sigma protocols on elliptic curves

   The following section now presents concrete instantiations for of
   Sigma protocols over elliptic curves.

   ::: remark Protocols for residue classes Because of their dominance,
   the presentation in the following focuses on proof goals over
   elliptic curves, therefore leveraging additive notation.  For prime-
   order subgroups of residue classes, all notation needs to be changed
   to multiplicative, and references to elliptic curves (e.g., curve)
   need to be replaced by their respective counterparts over residue
   classes. :::

3.1.  Ciphersuite Registry

   We advise for the use of prime-order elliptic curves of size either
   256 or 512 bits, depending on the desired security of the upper
   layers in the protocol
   // For instance, proving a DH relation with one fixed group element
   // such as a public key, might expose the protocol to cryptanalytic
   // attacks such as Brown-Gallant [@EPRINT:BroGal04] and Cheon's
   // attack [@EC:Cheon06], and some implementations might opt for
   // larger curve sizes.  We consider these attacks out of scope for
   // this standardization effort, and believe this analysis should be
   // deferred to the concrete security study of the larger protocol..

   ::: center Curve Identifier Security Level Sources -----------

   decaf] BLS12-381 '-bls12-381' 128 [@bls12] :::

   We denote with GG the prime-order group of the elliptic curve, with
   $GF(p)$ the scalar field, and with G the generator of GG chosen as
   per the curve parameters.  We assume that all above curve parameters
   also provide the following group operations: check for equality,
   identity, addition, and scalar multiplication.  Optionally,
   implementation might implement Pippenger's algorithm [@pippenger] for
   multi-scalar multiplication.  In addition, we consider:

   *  an identifier for the curve, chosen from the table above, and
      denoted $\textsf{curve}$;

   *  a deterministic sub-procedure a = FromBytes(b), taking as input a
      bit string b of length 32 bytes, and mapping it into an element a
      <-$- GF(p);

   *  a deterministic sub-procedure s = Serialize(P), taking as input a
      group element $P in GG$ and returning a fixed-length sequence of
      bits.  For elliptic curve groups, Serialize must provide a
      compressed representation of the _affine_ representation, such as
      the x-coordinate of P and one bit determining the sign of Y.

   *  a deterministic sub-procedure P = Deserialize(s), taking a (fixed-
      length and curve-dependent) sequence of bits and returning an
      elliptic curve point.  This procedure may raise an exception or
      output None if the conversion fails.

3.2.  Maurer proofs

   We describe an abstract class for proving knowledge of a preimage
   under an arbitrary _group homomorphism_, which is a mapping between
   two groups respecting the structure of the groups.  In particular, as
   will be discussed in 3.4 (Section 3.4), many statements related to
   discrete logarithms or representations in groups of prime order, can
   be expressed as statements over group homomorphisms.  For an in-depth
   discussion of the underlying theory we refer to Cramer [@cramer97].

   *Definition 1*. _For two groups $GG_1,GG_2$, a function
   $\varphi:GG_1\toGG_2:x\mapsto\varphi(x)$ is a *(group) homomorphism_,
   if and only if for all $a,b in GG_1$ it holds that
   $\varphi(a+b)=\varphi(a)+\varphi(b)$.* :::

   Readers not familiar with the notation of group homomorphism may
   think of $\varphi$ as a linear function from n elements into m
   elements.

   ::: example Discrete logarithm equality phi_DLEQ Looking at the
   relation R_DLEQ, the relevant homomorphism is given by: f_DLEQ :
   GF(p)\toGG^2 : w\mapsto (wG,wH) If equality of discrete logarithms
   within _different_ groups of the same prime order p is to be proven,
   the homomorphism to be considered would be: f_DLEQ' :
   GF(p)\toGG_1\timesGG_2 : w\mapsto (wG,wH) where G and H would now be
   generators for $GG_1$ and $GG_2$, respectively.  All the techniques
   discussed in the remainder of this spec equally apply to both cases.
   :::

   ::: example Representation phi_REP Looking at the relation ${R_rep}$,
   the relevant homomorphism is given by: φ_rep : GF(p)^2→GG :
   (w_1,w_2)↦ w_1 G + w_2 H. :::

   We provide a generic template for all Sigma protocols for statements
   of the following form over DLOG groups:

   R_dl ={ ((Y_1, ... ,Y_m),(w_1, ... ,w_n)) in GG^m * GF(p)^n: (Y_1,
   ... ,Y_m)=\varphi(w_1, ... ,w_n) }

   where $\varphi:GF(p)^n\toGG^m$ is a group homomorphism.

   ::: remark Selective disclosure of witnesses Note that in the
   following descriptions, all witnesses are assumed to be kept secret,
   i.e., none of them is disclosed to the verifier.  In case it is
   required to disclose $w_j$, as is the case, e.g., in the context of
   attribute-based credential systems, the relation to be proven can be
   rewritten as follows:

   R_dl'= { \begin{array}{r} ((Y_1', ... ,Y_m')),(w_1, ...
   ,w_{j-1},w_{j+1}, ... ,w_n)) in GG^m \times GF(p)^{n-1}: ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   (Y_1', ... ,Y_m')=\psi(w_1, ... ,w_{j-1},w_{j+1}, ... ,w_n)
   \end{array} }where\begin{aligned} (Y_1', ... ,Y_m') &:= (Y_1, ...
   ,Y_m)-\varphi(0, ... ,0,w_j,0, ... ,0)\text{ and}
   \psi(w_1, ... ,w_{j-1},w_{j+1}, ... ,w_n) &:= \varphi(w_1, ...
   ,w_{j-1},0,w_{j+1}, ... ,w_n).

   associated to the protocol_. These will be defined later in the
   specific protocols.

      DlogTemplate.simulate_commitment(c, s_vec):

      1.  $(Y_1, ... ,Y_m)=Y_vec$.

      2.  []{#item:basic:sim:s label="item:basic:sim:s"} $(s_1, ...
          ,s_n) =s_vec$.

      4.  $(T_1, ... ,T_m) =\varphi(s_1, ... ,s_n) - e\cdot(Y_1, ...
          ,Y_m)$.

      5.  Output $T_vec=(s_1, ... ,s_n)$.

3.3.  Linear relations

   While the above protocol allows one to efficiently prove knowledge of
   a pre-image under a homomorphism, many protocols found in the
   literature require one to prove relations among witnesses.
   Specifically, they require to prove relations like the following:
   {R_lin}=\set{((Y_1, ... ,Y_m),(w_1, ... ,w_n)) : \begin{array}{c}
   (Y_1, ... ,Y_m)=φ(w_1, ... ,w_n) \\ A⋅(w_1, ... ,w_n)^ in tercal =
   (b_1, ... ,b_k)^ in tercal\end{array}}, where the matrix $A in
   GF(p)^{k\times n}$ and vector $(b_1, ... ,b_k) in GF(p)^k$ specify
   the system of linear equations.

   In the following, we sketch how such relations can be translated into
   relations of the form discussed in 3.2 (Section 3.2).  We assume that
   A is of the following form: A = łeft(\begin{array}{cccccccc} a_{11} &
   ...  & a_{1k} & 1 & 0 & 0 & ...  & 0\\ a_{21} & ...  & a_{2k} & 0 & 1
   & 0 & ...  & ⋮\\ ⋮ & & ⋮ & ⋮ & & ⋮& & 0\\ ⋮ & & ⋮ & ⋮ & & 0 & 1 & 0\\
   a_{k1} & ...  & a_{kk} & 0 & ...  & ... & 0 & 1\\ \end{array}\right)
   Note that this is without loss of generality.  If the system of
   linear equations has a different form, the above form can always be
   achieved using Gaussian elimination [@shoup08 Sec. 14.4] and re-
   ordering of the witnesses.  Note that we only need to consider the
   case where $k<n$, as otherwise the linear equations would uniquely
   determine the witnesses, which is not desirable in our context.

   The following relation ${R_lin}'$ is now equivalent to that specified
   by ${R_lin}$: {R_lin}'=\set{((Y_1, ... ,Y_m),(w_1, ... ,w_{n−k})) :
   (Y_1, ... ,Y_m)=ψ(w_1, ... ,w_{n−k})} where \begin{aligned} ψ(w_1,
   ... ,w_{n−k}) &:= φ(w_1, ... ,w_{n−k},−∑_{i=1}^{n−k}a_{1i}w_i,
   ... ,−∑_{i=1}^{n−k}a_{ki}w_i)\text{ and}\\ (Y_1', ... ,Y_m') &:=
   (Y_1, ... ,Y_m) − φ(0, ... ,0,b_1, ... ,b_k). \end{aligned}

3.4.  Examples

   Let GG be a group over an elliptic curve with prime order p.  Denote
   with $G in GG$ a generator of GG.

3.4.1.  Schnorr signatures

   Schnorr signatures, also known as Schnorr proofs or DLOG proofs,
   prove knowledge of the discrete logarithm $w in GF(p)$ of a point
   $Y=wG$ in base G.

   *  $\varphi:GF(p)\toGG:w\mapsto wG$

   *  Schnorr.morphism_label(): return: $$\hash(\texttt{\textquotesingle
      {}schnorrsig\textquotesingle},~\textsf{curve}\mathbf{\mid}~Seriali
      ze(G) ,~Serialize(Y))$

   For a description of this proof goal in the general case of residue
   classes, we also refer to [@zkproof-reference 1.4.1].

3.4.2.  Discrete logarithm equality

   So-called DLEQ proofs prove equality of the discrete logarithm, that
   is: $Y_1 = wG$ and $Y_2 = wH$.

   *  $\varphi:GF(p)\toGG^2:w\mapsto (wG,wH)$

   *  Dleq.morphism_label(): return $$\hash(\texttt{\textquotesingle{}dl
      eq\textquotesingle},~\textsf{curve}\mathbf{\mid}~Serialize(G)
      ,~Serialize(H) ,~Serialize(Y_1) ,~Serialize(Y_2))$

3.4.3.  Diffie-Hellman

   Let GG be a group over an elliptic curve with prime order p.  Proving
   knowledge of the exponents of a valid Diffie-Hellman triple means
   proving knowledge of $w_1,w_2 in GF(p)$ such that $Y_1=w_1G$,
   $Y_2=w_2G$, and $Y_3=w_1 w_2 G$. The mapping
   $GF(p)^2\toGG^3:(w_1,w_2)\mapsto (w_1G,w_2G,w_1w_2G)$ is not a
   homomorphism, and consequently the basic protocol presented before
   cannot be deployed directly.  However, the required multiplicative
   relation can be proven by observing that the proof goal is equivalent
   to $Y_1=w_1G$, $Y_2=w_2G$, and $Y_3=w_2Y_1$, leading the homomorphism

   *  $\varphi:GF(p)^2\toGG^3:(w_1,w_2)\mapsto(w_1G,w_2G,w_2Y_1)$

   *  Dh.morphism_label() return:
      $$\hash(\texttt{\textquotesingle{}diffie-
      hellman\textquotesingle},~\textsf{curve}\mathbf{\mid}~Serialize(G)
      ,~Serialize(Y_1) ,~Serialize(Y_2))$

   As shown in this example, and in contrast to linear relations,
   multiplicative relations among witnesses typically require a
   reformulation of the proof goal.

3.4.4.  Representation

   Let GG be a group over an elliptic curve of prime order p, and let
   G_1, ... , G_m be generators of GG.  Proving knowledge of a valid
   opening of a Pedersen commitment means proving knowledge of w_1,w_2,
   ... , w_m in GF(p) such that Y=w_1G_1 + w_2G_2 + ... + w_m G_m.

   *  $\varphi:GF(p)^m\toGG:(w_1,w_2, ... , w_m)\mapsto \sum_i w_iG_i$

   *  Rep.morphism_label() returns $$\hash(\texttt{\textquotesingle{}rep
      resentation\textquotesingle},~\textsf{curve}\mathbf{\mid}~Serializ
      e(G_1) ,~\cdots ,~Serialize(G_m) ,~Serialize(Y))$

   ::: example Range proofs via bit decomposition Let GG be a cyclic
   group of prime order p, and let G and H be generators of GG, and let
   $\ell$ be a non-negative integer satisfying $\ell<\log_2 p$. Consider
   the following relation: {R_range} =
   \set{łeft(Y,(w_1,w_2))\right)~:~Y=w_1 G +w_2 H ~łand~ w_1 in
   [0,2^ℓ)}. Multiple techniques for proving that a secret witness lies
   within a certain range, cf. Morais et al. [@range-proof-survey] for a
   survey.  We will use the so-called _bit decomposition_ approach.

   To do so, the prover computes $w_{1,i} in \set{0,1}$ for $i=0, ...
   ,\ell-1$ such that $w_1=\sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1}2^iw_{1,i}$, and computes
   commitments to those individual bits, i.e., $Y_i=w_{1,i}G+w_{2,i}H$
   for $w_{2,i} <-$- GF(p)$. Furthermore, it sets $w^*=w_2-
   \sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1}2^iw_{2,i}$.

   Assuming that the discrete logarithm problem is hard in GG, the above
   relation is now equivalent to the following relation:
   $$\begin{aligned} {R_range}' = \bigg{\left((Y,(Y_i)_{i=0}^{\ell-
   1}),(w_1,w_2,(w_{2,i})_{i=0}^{\ell-1}),w^*)\right)~:~ Y=w_1 G +w_2 H
   ~\land~
   Y-\sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} 2^iY_i = w^* H ~\land~
   \bigwedge_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \left(Y_i=w_{2,i}H ~\lor~ Y_i-
   G=w_{2,i}H\right)\bigg}.

   \end{aligned}$$

   It can now be seen that the above ensures knowledge of the witnesses
   $w_1$ hidden within Y.  Furthermore, we guarantee that the values
   hidden within $Y_i$ correctly add up to $w_1$, i.e., that $w_1-
   \sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1}2^iw_{1,i}=0$. Finally, the two clauses ensure
   that each $Y_i$ is a commitment to either 0 or 1, thus implying the
   bound on $w_1$.

   The different clauses can finally be composed using nested protocol
   compositions from 2.5 (Section 5). :::

3.5.  Batch verification

   The batchable form can take advantage of the following fact.  Given
   $\ell$ verification equations of the form: T_i + c_i Y_i = ∑_j s_j
   G_{i,j} for $i=1, ... ,\ell$, the verifier can sample a random vector
   of coefficients $a_vec in GF(p)^\ell$ and instead test:
   łeft(∑_{i=1}^{ℓ} a_i T_i\right) + łeft(∑_{i=1}^{ℓ} a_i ⋅ c_i Y_i
   \right) = łeft(∑_{i=1}^{ℓ} a_i ⋅ ∑_j s_j G_{i,j}\right).  If the
   matrix $G_{i, j}$ of generators has identical rows, by linearity the
   right-hand side can be computed as a single scalar product.  If the
   statements $Y_i$'s have identical rows, by linearity the second term
   in the equation can be computed as a single scalar product.

   In any case, the test can be efficiently implemented as a single
   multiscalar multiplication, minimizing the number of group operations
   needed: łeft(∑_{i=1}^{ℓ} a_i T_i\right) + łeft(∑_{i=1}^{ℓ} (a_i ⋅
   c_i) Y_i \right) + łeft(∑_{i=1}^{ℓ}∑_j (−a_i ⋅ s_j) G_{i,j}\right) =
   0.

   The random vector $a_vec$ can be _deterministically_ generated by
   fixing $a_1 = 1$ and setting $(a_2, ... , a_{\ell}) =\prg(H(c,
   s_vec))$ [@bip-schnorr].

4.  Encoding the statement

   Statements in Sigma protocols take the form of a labeled binary tree:
   Statement is either:

   *  a label [AND]{.sans-serif}, or [OR]{.sans-serif}, and two children
      [left]{.sans-serif} and [right]{.sans-serif} of type Statement

   *  a StatementLeaf instance.  Objects of this type depend on the
      specific algebraic setting used, and will be treated later.

   Statements are serialized depth-first.  There are many different
   options for serialization that could be considered:

   *  Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) RFC7049
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7049)

   *  The zk proof Reference document provides a serialization document
      for r1cs [@zkproof-reference 3.4.2], but there is nothing in it.

5.  Composition of Sigma Protocols

   []{#sec:or-comp label="sec:or-comp"} []{#sec:and-comp label="sec:and-
   comp"} Sigma protocols can be composed to prove knowledge of multiple
   independent witnesses (_AND composition_), and for proving knowledge
   for one out of a set of witnesses (_OR composition_).  An object
   SigmaProtocol can be seen as a recursive enumeration

       enum SigmaProtocol {
         AndComposition {left: SigmaProtocol, right: SigmaProtocol},
         OrComposition  {left: SigmaProtocol, right: SigmaProtocol},
         [...]
       }

   whose instances expose the methods described above.  The dots [...]
   denote (optional) Sigma protocols instantiations that will be covered
   later.  Without loss of generality, the techniques presented in the
   following focus on the composition of two protocols.  Composition of
   multiple protocols (e.g., proving knowledge of a witness for one out
   of many statements) can be achieved by recursively applying
   composition of two protocols.

5.1.  AND Composition

   In this section we show how to construct a Sigma protocol proving
   knowledge of multiple independent witnesses, e.g., knowledge of
   multiple secret keys, or openings to multiple commitments.  That is,
   a Sigma protocol for the following relation:

   R_and = {
     ((Y_0,Y_1),(w_0,w_1) : (Y_0,w_0) in R_0 AND (Y_1,w_1) in R_1
   }

   For the rest of this section, the witness w for the Sigma protocol
   will now be a pair $(w_0, w_1)$ of witnesses, and the associated
   statement Y will be a pair $(Y_0, Y_1)$ of statements, where $w_0$ is
   the witness for the statement $Y_0$, and $w_1$ is the witness for
   $Y_1$.

   Intuitively, the AND composition simply runs the instances of the
   different protocols to be composed in parallel, using the same
   challenge c for both instances.  The verifier will then accept the
   protocol run, if and only if all instances of the partial protocols
   output True.

   The resulting Sigma protocol is specified by the following
   algorithms:

   -

`AndComposition.new(ctx, left, right)`: internally store `left` and `right`.

   -

   (T_vec, pstate) <- AndComposition.prover_commit(w_vec):
   (w_0,w_1)=w_vec`
   (T_0, pstate_0)<- left.prover_commit(w_0)
   (T_1, pstate_1)<-`right.prover_commit(w_1)
   return (T_vec,pstate) = ((T_0,  T_1),(pstate_0, pstate_1))

   -

   s_vec<- AndComposition.prover_response(pstate, c)
   (pstate_0,pstate_1)= pstate`
   s_0 <- left.prover_response(pstate_0, c)`
   s_1 <- right.prover_response(pstate_1, c)`
   return `s_vec=(s_0,s_1)`

   -

   AndComposition.verifier(T_vec, c, s_vec)
   (s_0, s_1)=s_vec$.
   return (left.verifier(T_0,c, s_0) and right.verifier(T_1,c, s_1))

   -

   AndComposition.label() is computed as:
   $H((\texttt{\textquotesingle{}and-composition\textquotesingle}\mathbf
   {\mid}~left.label(),~right.label())$ The supported hash functions are
   described in [@draft-orru-zkproof-fs].

   -

   s_vec <- AndComposition.simulate_response()
   s_0 <- left.simulate_response()
   s_1 <- right.simulate_response()
   return s_vec = (s_0,s_1)

   -

   T_vec <- AndComposition.simulate_commitment(c, s_vec):
   (s_0,s_1) = s_vec
   T_0 <- left.simulate_commitment(c,s_0)
   T_1 <- right.simulate_commitment(c,s_1)
   return T_vec = (T_0, T_1)

   ::: warning Witness equality Note that the AND-composition defined in
   the following gives no guarantee about equality of the witnesses: if
   the same witness is used across different clauses of the AND-
   composition, the protocol will not guarantee that they are indeed the
   same.  How to achieve such claims is discussed in
   (#sec:linear_relations). :::

5.2.  OR Composition

   In the following we explain how to construct a Sigma protocol proving
   knowledge of one out of a set of witnesses, for instance one of a set
   of secret keys (like ring signatures).  That is, the algorithms
   specified below constitute a Sigma protocol for the following
   relation:

   R_or = {
       ((Y_0,Y_1),(w_0,w_1) :
       (Y_0,w_0) in  R_0 OR (Y_1,w_1) in R_1
   }

   The statement Y is the pair $(Y_0, Y_1)$ of the composing statements,
   and the witness w is the pair $(w_0, w_1)$ of the witnesses for the
   respective relation.  One of the witness can be set to
   $\mathsf{None}$. In the following protocol specification, let j be
   such that $w_j$ is known to the prover, whereas without loss of
   generality $w_{1-j}$ is assumed to be unknown to the prover.

   On a high level, the protocol works as follows.  Using the simulator,
   the prover first simulates a transcript for the unknown witness
   (keeping the challenge and response of this transcript temporarily
   secret), and generates an honest commitment for the known witness.
   Having received the challenge, the prover then computes challenge for
   the known witness, depending on the received challenge and the one
   from the simulated transcript.  Having computed the response, the
   prover transfers the responses of both transcripts, as well as the
   partial challenges to the verifier, who accepts if and only if both
   instances of the partial protocols output True and the partial
   challenges correctly add up to the random challenge.

   The main procedures of the resulting Sigma protocol are specified by
   the following algorithms:

   *  OrComposition.new(ctx, left, right): internally store left and
      right.

   -

(T_vec, pstate) <- OrComposition.prover_commit(w_vec)`:
Prover = [left, right]
(w_0,w_1)=w_vec`, and let $j in \bin$ be the first index for which $w[j]!= None$
(T_j,`pstate`_j)<-Prover[j].prover_commit(Y_j,w_j)
s_{1-j}<-Prover`[1-j].`simulate_response()
hoose a random $c_{1-j}$ in $\mathcal{C}$
T_{1-j}<- Prover[1-j].simulate_commitment(c_{1-j},s_{1-j})
return `(T_vec, pstate) =((T_0,T_1),(pstate[j],c_{1-j},s_{1-j}))

   *  s_vec <- OrComposition.prover_response(pstate, c):

      1.  (pstate[j],c[1-j],s_[1-j])=pstate

      2.  c[j]= c XOR c[1-j]

      3.  s[j] <- Prover[j].prover_response(pstate[j], c[j])

      4.  Return $s_vec=(s_0,s_1, c_0)$.

   *  OrComposition.verifier(T_vec, c, s_vec),

      (s_0, s_1, c_0) = s_vec c_1= c\oplus c_0 return
      (left.verifier(T_0,c_0,s_0) and right.verifier(T_1,c_1,s_1))

   *  OrComposition.label() is computed as:
      $H((\texttt{\textquotesingle{}or-composition\textquotesingle}\math
      bf{\mid}~left.label(),~right.label())$

   *  s_vec<- OrComposition.simulate_response()

      1.  $(Y_0,Y_1)=Y_vec$.

      2.  $s_0<-left.simulate_response()

      3.  $s_1<-right.simulate_response()

      4.  Choose a random $c_0$ in $\mathcal{C}$.

      5.  Return $s_vec=(s_0,s_1,c_0)$.

   -

   T_vec<- OrComposition.simulate_commitment(c, s_vec):
   (s_0,s_1,c_0)=s_vec
   c_1= c XOR c_0
   T_0 <-left.simulate_commitment(c_0,s_0)
   T_1<-right.simulate_commitment(c_1,s_1)
   return T_vec=(T_0,T_1)
