# SHO API

A stateful hash objects can absorb inputs incrementally and squeeze variable-length unpredictable messages.

## The API

- `SHO.init(iv) -> sho`, creates a new `sho` object with a description;
- `sho.absorb(values)`, absorbs a list of "native" elements (that is, elements in the same domain of the hash function);
- `sho.squeeze(length)`, squeezes from the `sho` object a list of "native" elements
- `sho.finalize()`, deletes the hash object safely.


## Initialization vector for generic protocols


## Sigma protocols example

Two hash states are needed, one public and one private for nonce generation. They are built as follows.

    iv  = SHA3-256(label)
    challenge = SHAKE128(iv || commitment)
    private_nonce = SHAKE128(iv || random || pad || witness)
